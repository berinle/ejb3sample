This is a sample project with using ejb3

To Use hibernate has a provider, do the following...

1) Add this to your persistence unit (in persistence.xml)

<provider>org.hibernate.ejb.HibernatePersistence</provider>

2) Set a transaction manager to the server you are running against since
hibernate queries this

For WLS server

<properties>
	<property name="hibernate.transaction.factory_class" value="org.hibernate.transaction.JTATransactionFactory"/>
 	<property name="hibernate.transaction.manager_lookup_class" value="org.hibernate.transaction.WeblogicTransactionManagerLookup"/>
</properties>

3) For WLS, add antlr.jar contained in your version of Hibernate to the
PRE_CLASSPATH has this causes conflict with what comes with weblogic server.

If not, you are going to be getting the all to familiar error

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: org.hibernate.QueryException: ClassNotFoundException: org.hibernate.hql.ast.HqlToken [select a from beans.Auction a]
